Problem Statement-
The problem statement given was to monitor online child abuse. Child abuse or child maltreatment is physical, sexual, or psychological maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a parent or other caregiver. Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or other caregiver that results in actual or potential harm to a child, and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with.

Solution-
The possible solution should be to prevent it. We know that prevention is better than cure. The basic problem why child abuse is happening due to lack of knowledge amongst the infants. Our project, CHILD ABUSE can therefore help in the education of child through an interactive manner. Also it can help parents to teach their child about the things which seem to them as embarrassment.
